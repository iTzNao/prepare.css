# Prepare.css

‚≠ê Star me on GitHub - it motivates me a lot!

This is just my take on a styles reset, I personally will be using this as my new main styles reset, due to how easy, simple and useful it is.

### New Features:

1.  **Highlight:** Why has this not been added to CSS already, anyways you use `<h>` or `<highlight>`, its self explanatory.
