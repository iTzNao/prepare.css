# Prepare.css

This is just my take on a styles reset, I personally will be using this as my new main styles reset, due to how easy, simple and useful it is.

### New Features:

1.  **Highlight:** Why has this not been added to CSS already, anyways you use `<h>` or `<highlight>`, its self explanatory.

### How to use:
You can download the file and import it:
```css
@import "prepare.css"
```

You can reference the online file, hosted here on GitHub, this will ensure that is up to date.
```css
@import URL
```

You can reference a specific online file version.
```css
@import URL
```
