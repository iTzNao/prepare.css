# Prepare.css

This is just my take on a styles reset, I personally will be using this as my new main styles reset, due to how easy, simple and useful it is.

### New CSS Features:

1.  **Highlight:** Why has this not been added to CSS already, anyways you use `<h>` or `<highlight>`, it is self explanatory.

### How to use:
You can download the file and import it:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="prepare.css"> <!-- HTML import -->
```
```css
@import "prepare.css" /* CSS import */
```

You can reference the latest online file, hosted here on GitHub:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://github.com/iTzNao/prepare.css/releases/download/1.0.0/prepare.css"> <!-- HTML import -->
```
```css
@import url("https://github.com/iTzNao/prepare.css/releases/download/1.0.0/prepare.css") /* CSS import */
```
